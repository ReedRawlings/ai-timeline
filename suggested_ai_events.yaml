  description: "The European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act officially entered into force, becoming the world's first comprehensive AI regulation framework. The legislation establishes a risk-based approach to AI governance, prohibiting certain AI practices deemed unacceptably risky (such as social scoring and real-time biometric identification), while imposing strict requirements on high-risk AI systems in sectors like healthcare, education, and law enforcement. The Act also introduces specific obligations for general-purpose AI models with systemic risk (using more than 10^25 FLOPs in training), requiring safety evaluations, risk assessments, and incident reporting. This landmark regulation is expected to influence global AI governance standards through the 'Brussels Effect.'"

  description: "California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed Senate Bill 1047, the 'Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier AI Models Act,' which would have imposed safety requirements on AI companies developing large-scale models. The bill required developers of AI models trained with more than $100 million in compute to implement safety protocols, conduct third-party audits, and maintain shutdown capabilities. Newsom's veto cited concerns about regulating AI based solely on computational resources rather than actual deployment risks and potential impacts. The decision sparked significant debate about the appropriate approach to AI regulation, balancing innovation with safety concerns, and highlighted tensions between state and federal regulatory approaches."

  description: "The Australian Federal Police's Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation (ACCCE) reported a sharp increase in AI-generated child abuse material, often created by school-age children to harass classmates using deepfake technology. Two men were arrested in 2024 for possessing or creating such AI-generated content. AFP Commander Helen Schneider emphasized that any depiction of minors in abusive scenarios—whether real or synthetic—constitutes illegal child abuse material under Australian law. This trend highlights the dark side of accessible AI generation tools and the urgent need for stronger safeguards, education, and law enforcement responses to protect children from AI-enabled exploitation."
