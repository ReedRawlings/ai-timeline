Anthropic case: he found that training Claude on copyrighted books without permission constituted fair use under copyright law, calling it 'quintessentially transformative' like 'any reader aspiring to be a writer,' but simultaneously ruled that Anthropic's acquisition and storage of over 7 million pirated books in a 'central library' was copyright infringement not protected by fair use. The judge ordered a December trial to determine damages for the piracy violations, noting that purchasing books later would not absolve Anthropic of liability for the initial theft, though it may affect statutory damages up to $150,000 per work."

The court found that Ross directly copied over 2,200 copyrighted headnotes through intermediary 'bulk memos' to create a competing legal search product, distinguishing this non-generative AI case from generative AI training scenarios."
